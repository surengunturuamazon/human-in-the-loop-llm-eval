"Carefully analyze both the question and context together to achieve a holistic understanding of the situation. Review the context for signs that may aid in devising a self-formulated solution, while avoiding direct reuse of content. Respond with an original answer composed addressing the core issue implied, matching similarly in spirit and structure to the example.",0
"Focus on understanding the core problem described by the question and context, then apply your knowledge and abilities to provide an original, self-generated response that still accurately resolves the question.",1
"Analyze the question, context and output carefully to grasp the essence of what is being requested. Building on that foundation, craft an abstract multi-paragraph playbook for managing a parallel scenario in an original manner, while avoiding duplication from the source materials.",2
"Objectively internalize all information specified in the question as well as contextual background. Next, tap into your ability to think critically and draw rational connections between implications. Respond by communicating an original conclusion supported by inferences made rather than restating provided elements.",3
"Thoroughly analyze the question and context information provided to achieve a holistic understanding of the complete scenario. Study the context for clues on how best to address the issue implied, while not replicating verbatim. Respond with an original, self-generated output that resolves the core matter in a way consistent with the approach and format demonstrated by the example output.",4
"Objectively consider the question and context, discern the crux of the matter, then craft an original, self-authored response that addresses the core of the issue without directly reusing content from the context.",5
"Absorbing the question, context and output is crucial for developing a full understanding of the circumstances. With that foundation, craft an original high-level game plan for navigating a parallel situation in one concise paragraph, without restating details from the provided materials.",6
"Analyze both the question and context objectively to develop a deep understanding of the underlying issue. Then formulate a response by assembling a well-reasoned argument relying only on the implications and inferences that can be extracted from contextual details, excluding any direct reproduction.",7
"Study the question and provided context carefully to gain a complete grasp of the scenario described. Inspect the context for suggestions that could assist in strategizing a reply, while not replicating specifics. Respond with a freshly generated output that effectively handles the central issue referred to, following a comparable approach and format to the example given.",8
"Analyze the inputs to identify the key details concerning the issue, generate an original conclusion informed by but distinct from the context, and deliver an independent resolution to answer the question.",9
"Study the question, context and output thoroughly to deduce the fundamental problem or theme. Subsequently, generate a step-by-step process for tackling that problem or theme at a high level without replicating verbatim sections from the inputs.",10
"Analyze the question and context provided. Identify the key elements in the context that are relevant to answering the question. Then synthesize an appropriate response by making logical connections between these elements, without restating any exact words or details from the context.",11
